# Employee-Attrition-Dashboard-for-HR-Department
This project looks at why employees leave or stay, from the view of a junior business analyst working with the HR team. Using Tableau and a detailed dataset, it explores how factors like age, job role, income, and satisfaction influence attrition, aiming to help HR build better strategies to keep employees engaged.

The repository contains two files.

One file contains the Tableau Dashboard of the Employee-Attrition and the other file contains a report that includes findings, trends and written analysis with screenshots
