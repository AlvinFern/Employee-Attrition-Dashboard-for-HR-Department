# Employee-Attrition-Dashboard-for-HR-Department
This project looks at why employees leave or stay, from the view of a junior business analyst working with the HR team. Using Tableau and a detailed dataset, it explores how factors like age, job role, income, and satisfaction influence attrition, aiming to help HR build better strategies to keep employees engaged.

**Insights and Analysis**

**Age Distribution based on Employee Attrition**

The graph suggests a significant correlation between employee age and attrition. Younger employees, particularly those between 20 and 35 years old, appear to have a higher propensity to leave the company compared to their older counterparts. The number of employees who stayed with the company steadily increases with age.


**Attrition by Job Roles**

This bar chart displays the attrition rate across different job roles. The job roles specified in the graph are: 
-	Healthcare Representative 
-	Human Resource 
-	Laboratory Technician 
-	Manager 
-	Manufacturing Director 
-	Research Director 
-	Research Scientist 
-	Sales Executive
-	Sales Representative 

We can see in the below filtered (Yes) bar chart, that Sales Executive, Research Scientist, and Laboratory Technician display higher rate of attrition compared to the rest of the job roles.
Similarly most employees that worked as Sales Executive, Research Scientist, and Laboratory Technician also remained at the company. This can mean that each employee had a unique experience at these roles that influnenced some to leave and some to stay. 

**Income Range by Atrrition**

The income range and employee attrition is represented in the form of a box plot. 
For both employees who departed and those who stayed, the medians are essentially at the same level. This implies that there may not be noticeable variations in the two groups' median incomes.

But the leavers' (Yes) box is positioned a slightly lower than the stayers' (No) box. This might point to a pattern where employees who make a little less money are more inclined to quit the company.

For both boxes, the whisker lengths are comparable. This implies that there is similarity between the two groups in the income data scattered outside of the quartiles.

There is one outlier for ‘no’ attrition with the income range being $7000-$9999 in which the employee count is 132. 95 employees who left the company has been plotted outside the box where the income range is $2000-$2999 making it a low-income range.

**Job Satisfaction by Attrition**

In a general overview, some employees that are least satisfied left the company as shown in the above Figure. While most employees that are least satisfied continued with the same company. As the satisfaction increases more employees stayed with the company. The age filter is also displayed to show the different age range of employees that are satisfied with their job in regard to the attrition rate. 

**Final Dashboard**

Employees that earn $2000-$2999 have the highest attrition amongst other income groups. Meanwhile in the ‘No’ attrition bar chart, employees that earn from $3000-$4999 are most likely to stay in the company along with people earning from $2000-$2999 and from $10000-$12000 a month. 

Employees that left the company received a salary hike of 13%-14%, however most employees that stayed with the company also received a salary hike of 13%-14%. 
Employees that received a hike of 22%-26% are least likely to leave the company as demonstrated on the with the color blue.  

Majority of employees that left the company trained 2-3 times last year. Employees that trained more than 4 times, however, had lower rate of attrition. 
Most of the employees that stayed in the company also trained 2-3 but only 62 employees that trained only once has stayed with the company. 



The repository contains two files.

One file contains the Tableau Dashboard of the Employee-Attrition and the other file contains a report that includes findings, trends and written analysis with screenshots.
